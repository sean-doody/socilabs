      <description>Introduction This advanced tutorial will go over how to create custom Twitter datasets by collecting data from the official Twitter API. It assumes you have already installed Python and Anaconda and are comfortable coding in Python.
The coding examples contained in this codelab can be implemented in your favorite text editor and run as a standalone Python program, or integrated into an IDE or notebook environment like Jupyter Lab.
Note: This tutorial uses the standard search features of the Twitter API.</description>

      <description>Python is an extremely popular programming language that has quickly become the language of choice for programmers, data scientists, and computational social scientists alike due to its rich ecosystem of statistical and data management libraries, a vibrant open source community, and its clean and easy to read syntax.
While Python can be installed by itself from the official website, for most social science researchers, it makes much more sense to install Python as part of the Anaconda distribution.</description>
